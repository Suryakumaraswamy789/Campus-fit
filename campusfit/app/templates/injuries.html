      <h3>Lower Back Strain</h3>
      <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Often caused by improper form during deadlifts or squats, lifting too heavy, or rounding the back.<br><strong>Prevention:</strong> Always maintain a neutral spine. Engage your core muscles. Warm up properly and never ego-lift. Ask a mentor to check your form.</p>

      <h3>Shoulder Impingement</h3>
      <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff become pinched. This is often due to poor form on overhead presses or lateral raises, or muscle imbalances around the shoulder.<br><strong>Prevention:</strong> Strengthen your rotator cuff muscles with external rotation exercises. Avoid flaring your elbows on pressing movements. Ensure you have proper shoulder mobility before lifting overhead.</p>
      
      <h3>Runner's Knee (Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome)</h3>
      <p><strong>Cause:</strong> A dull ache around the front of the kneecap, often caused by overuse from running or jumping. Weak quadriceps and hip muscles can also contribute.<br><strong>Prevention:</strong> Strengthen the quadriceps and glutes. Always wear appropriate footwear. Avoid sudden, drastic increases in your training volume. Stretch your hamstrings and hip flexors regularly.</p>

      <h3>Wrist Strain</h3>
      <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Common in pressing exercises like the bench press or overhead press when the wrist is bent back too far. Can also happen during curls with improper form.<br><strong>Prevention:</strong> Keep your wrists straight and strong during lifts (your knuckles should point towards the ceiling). Use wrist wraps for very heavy sets if needed. Perform wrist flexibility and strengthening exercises.</p>
